        <h2>Introduction to Automotive Engineering</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        The automotive industry has evolved over the last century into one of the most complex and innovative industries. Automotive engineering combines a variety of disciplines including **mechanical engineering**, **electrical engineering**, **aerodynamics**, and **material science** to design and produce vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
        In recent years, the focus has shifted to developing **electric vehicles (EVs)**, **autonomous driving systems**, **connected car technologies**, and **sustainable materials** to meet environmental challenges and enhance the driving experience.
