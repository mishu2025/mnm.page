        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>
          I started my academic journey with a <strong>B.Sc. in Civil Engineering</strong> from <strong>Mekelle University</strong>, Ethiopia. I then continued my education in Germany, earning an <strong>M.Sc. in Computational Engineering in Science</strong> from the <strong>Technical University of Braunschweig</strong>, and later a <strong>Dr.-Ing.</strong> from the <strong>Helmholtz-Center-Geesthacht & University of Kiel</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My career began with the <strong>German Aerospace Center (DLR)</strong>, where I focused on the <strong>numerical investigation of CFRP structures</strong>. From there, I expanded into more complex domains like the <strong>Automotive</strong> industry, working on safety systems and interior components for <strong>Volkswagen, Porsche</strong>, and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am exploring new frontiers in <strong>AI-driven simulation automation</strong> and how machine learning can enhance simulation processes.

        <h3>Doctoral & Post-Doctoral Research</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        My doctoral and post-doctoral research was conducted at <strong>HZH (formerly HZG)</strong> and the <strong>Technical Faculty of CAU Kiel</strong>. The focus of my research was on material modeling and numerical simulations of metal forming processes, particularly for lightweight materials such as magnesium alloys.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time, I worked on a variety of projects, including the experimental and numerical investigation of sheet forming in magnesium alloys, as well as developing predictive models for material behavior under different forming conditions.
      </p>

        <h3>Research Contributions</h3>
      </div>
      <p>As part of my doctoral research at the Fraunhofer IWM and TU Bergakademie Freiberg, I worked extensively on magnesium alloy sheet forming—a crucial topic in lightweight design for mobility sectors.</p>
