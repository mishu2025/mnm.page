        <h2>Introduction to Machine Learning & AI</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        <strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong> and <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> are two of the most transformative technologies shaping the future of industries today. While AI refers to systems that mimic human intelligence, ML focuses on algorithms that allow machines to improve their performance with experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ability of machines to analyze data, learn from it, and make predictions or decisions has revolutionized fields like healthcare, automotive, finance, and more. The integration of <strong>ML</strong> and <strong>AI</strong> in various systems is driving automation, enhancing decision-making, and enabling new breakthroughs in research and development.
