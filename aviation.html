        <h2>Introduction to Aviation</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Aviation encompasses the design, development, production, and operation of aircraft and spacecraft. It is a cornerstone of modern transportation, logistics, and exploration. The field of aviation involves not only the construction of aircraft but also sophisticated engineering disciplines like <strong>aerodynamics</strong>, <strong>materials science</strong>, <strong>control systems</strong>, and <strong>propulsion</strong> technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Innovations in aviation have led to dramatic improvements in <strong>safety</strong>, <strong>efficiency</strong>, and <strong>environmental impact</strong>. Research into <strong>electric aircraft</strong>, <strong>autonomous drones</strong>, and <strong>sustainable fuel sources</strong> is ongoing, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in flight technologies.
